# Van (Morgan) Patterson

## Professionally

- Predominantly from a "devops" background

  I've had the joy of working with lots of developers, so despite my skillset being primarily used for CICD and infrastructure, I've picked up some programming along the way. Most of my experience is in python, but I dabble in node, go, and rust.

- Infrastructure includes security and finance

  Just because you can provision an EC2 instance, doesn't mean you need anything bigger than a t2.micro for that test app you want to deploy. I'll personally find you if you open that security group on all ports to 0.0.0.0/0

- I've been working on my soft skills and agile/team lead skills as well, though this is a work in progress. People are generally way more complicated than applications.

## Hobbies/Interests

1. Electronics tinkering
   Like I'm sure you've gathered if you've poked around this site long, I tinker with computers a good bit. Usually this comes in the form of self hosting, smart home, and some hardware, like my custom mechanical keyboards.
1. I play some video games
   Currently, Risk of Rain and Satisfactory are some of my favorites, but some classics like portal have a special place in my heart as well.
