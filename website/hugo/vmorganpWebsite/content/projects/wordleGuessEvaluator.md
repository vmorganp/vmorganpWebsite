# Why

This is a project I did to make it easier to see how many words are left depending on your wordle guesses.
The real reason this exists, is because sometimes I'd make guesses that left me with one possible word, and my girlfriend was giving me flak for taking forever to do wordle because I coudln't think of the one word remaining. So basically I built this to justify spending 30 minutes trying to come up with a word.

# How

Given a solution, and a guess for a particular game of wordle, as well as the word lists used by wordle, one can determine what words are left in the lists, and tell the user what those words are.
